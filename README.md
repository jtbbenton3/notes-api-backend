# Notes API Backend


# Iâ€™m building a Flask API with JWT authentication for a Notes app. Users can register, log in, and manage their own notes with CRUD operations. The GET /notes endpoint will have pagination, and all endpoints will be protected to ensure only the owner can access their notes.
